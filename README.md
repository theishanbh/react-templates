## Introduction

This repository contains templates for various React hooks and libraries. Each template is designed to be a starting point that you can customize to fit your specific needs.

## Templates

### useContext Hook Template

The `useContext` hook is a powerful way to pass data through your component tree without having to manually pass props at every level. Our template provides a simple and scalable way to implement the `useContext` hook in your projects.

### useReducer Hook Template

The `useReducer` hook is a great alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic in your components. It is especially useful when the state depends on previous state values or when state transitions are encapsulated in a reducer function. Our template provides a straightforward and scalable way to implement the `useReducer` hook in your projects.
